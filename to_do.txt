- add player, match, and round tables
	- I want to add a table for each player on our team. I don't want to expose
	Uplay gamer tags, so maybe just use first names.
	- I figure we can use a UUID primary key field for each match and round entry.
	- Since there's only going to be Five players in the player table, we can just 
	use Integer type field for player IDs. SQLite auto increments this field type
	if it isnt explicity assigned a value.
- add API for orgs, operators, weapons, and players
	- This is pretty easy and straight forward. Just add properties to the 
	table/class definitions and a route def in the python code to return a JSON
	object.
- add login with google OAuth V2 for Chris and Mike
	- got to create a profile in the google developer's console to get a client ID	
	and secret.
- remove versioning from README. replace with major update dates.
	- After doing some research on versioning and web applications, I've decided
	versioning isnt necessary in this particular instance. We'll just update this 
	section of the README with major changes and the date the changes were pushed.
- stlye
	- Black Beard leading the way!
